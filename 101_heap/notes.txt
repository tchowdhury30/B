HW101 -- Heap o'Trouble
2022-05-17t
time spent: 0.5 hrs

DISCO:
* We can use the in-order traversal to find the node we want to remove.
* For adding an element in min-heap, instead of recursively adding the insert node's children,
  we can set the left or right children of the remove node to the left or right children of the current node.

QCC:
* How do we know whether to insert a node in the left or right subtree if there is a spot available in both?
* How do we deal with duplicate nodes?
