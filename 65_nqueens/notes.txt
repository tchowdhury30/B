HW65 -- How Many Queens Can a Thinker Place, If a Thinker Can Place Queens...
2022-02-16
time spent: 1.0 hrs

DISCOS:
- We can test multiple board sizes quickly in the main method by utilizing a for loop and increasing the board's size by 1 each time.
- 2x2 and 3x3 boards have no solutions. Sketching it out also confirms that this is indeed impossible.
- addQueen and removeQueen are used to make and terminate new branches of the recursive tree depending on whether they lead to a solution.

QCCs:
- What is the non-recursive way to approaching the N Queens problem?
- Is there a way to display all possible arrangements of Queens within a certain sized board all at once?
