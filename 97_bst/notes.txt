DISCO:
* DNF
* We first put _parent in BST before making it an attribute of TreeNode
* We had two base cases and one recursive case

QCC:
* How do we make the chosen child inherit the target's children if it is a direct child of the target
  bc we can't make it parent itself
    - Check if the chosen one's parent is the same as the target:
      inheritor.getParent() ==  target

ALGO:
* First search we have to search for the Node that has the target value we are trying to remove
* Then we check if it has two children:
     If it does:
        Find the max of the right subtree lineage and choose it as the inheritor which will replace the target
     If it doesn't:
        We set the inheritor to whatever it did have.
    Set inheritor's parent to null
    Then we compared the value in the inheritor to the value of the target to decide whether the parent of the target would adopt the inheritor to the right subtree lineage or the left
    Set the target's parent's child to the inheritor
    Set the inheritors children to the targets children
