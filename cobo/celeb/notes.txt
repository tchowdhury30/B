time spent: 4 hours

DISCOs:
* We learned how to make a GUI in Java and about the various methods.

QCCs:
* What do the imports in CelebrityFrame.java and CelebrityPanel.java exactly import (eg: java.awt.CardLayout, javax.swing.JFrame)?
* What are ActionListeners and ActionEvents?
* How does the putConstraint() method work and what parameters does it take?
* What do we have to create a superclass of for the Open-Ended Activity?

Activity 1
1. Classes used: CelebrityGame, Celebrity and subclasses, Game
2. Instance variables: name, preferred gender, age range, profession,
living status, guessed?
3. Game methods: play, update score, take turn, reset game, show results
4. update score, reset game, rest would be part of main method
5. play method allows a player to do a turn (1 min) and count them; during every turn
the player makes as many guesses as possible to get the correct celebrity given clues
6. a student object does learn, study, test methods and can have instant variables like
grade and GPA.
7. The student object can also have school, mindset, schedule instant variables

Activity 2
1. Constructors set up the instance variables in a class
2. The Constructor can be overloaded and take in parameters to further
control the instance variables
3. Celebrity class needs the instance variables of clue and name
4. The Celebrity class methods are getClue, getAnswer, setClue, setAnswer
7. public Celebrity() { _name = null; _clue = null; }
  This sets all the instance variables to a default value of null when nothing is given

Activity 3
1. The chosen swing component is the JFrame class, which is basically the
window that the player interacts with and it has all the other game components.
Possible properties are scaling, size, and background.
2. private ArrayList<Celebrity> celebGameList;
3. Yes, it will match because instance variables are typically private
12. CelebrityGame
13. No knowledge

Activity 4
1. Class Name: Actor; Attributes: famous movies/tv shows, famous roles.
17. It has the @Override marker.
18. Use the super() method.
19. extends
20. It upcasts the subclass instance.

Activity 5
1. We chose to implement this program because we were in a building at that time and wanted to create our own house.
2. We have a Building superclass which has the floor and people instance variables.
   We then created a House subclass that is able to return the house number.
3. We can design a School subclass as well. The School subclass would the number of classes and can return the school name.
4. INSTANCE VARIABLES:
      -   int   _floors
      -   int   _people
    METHODS:
      +   int   getFloors()
      +   int   getPeople()
      +   int   getHouseNumber()
5. Building block = new House(12, 1, "123");
