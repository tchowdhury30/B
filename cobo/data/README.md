Our Experiences:

In class we worked on Activity 2 and 3 since those required actual java files. We worked on making the class file for activity 2. For activity 3, we ran into trouble compiling all the Welcome Jave files. Instead, to make sure we were not wasting time and to answer the questions, we just went to the website itself and done what the program would have done. Eventually we were able to figure out a way to compile the files which helped us answer one of the questions that needed to be computer aided.

We decided to do a divide and conquer approach to this lab. Tasnim did part of the ReadMe and Activity1. Diana did the notes and Activity2. Faiza did finished the ReadMe and did Activity3. The team flag was drawn by Faiza and Lettered (is that even a word) by Diana.
