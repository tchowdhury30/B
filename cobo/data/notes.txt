DISCO:
* Running "javac -classpath .:../sinbad.jar -d . Welcome01.java" and "java -classpath .:../sinbad.jar Welcome01"
  in GitBash instead of the Terminal allowed us to successfully compile and run our code.
* sinbad.jar allows us to use data from live data services in our code.
* We need to import core.data.* to import the Sinbad library.
* connect() allows us to connect to the URL of the data service.
* load() downloads the data provided by the URL.
* You can view the page source to see where and how the program was fetching its data.

QCC:
* What are some real world applications that utilize Sinbad?

TRUBZ:
* In Activity 3, we initially had trouble compiling Welcome01, Welcome02_Object, and Welcome03_List.
* We checked the README and used the given commands but it did not work.
* Then, we checked Piazza and found that many others were having this issue as well.
* We noticed a comment from TNZ that the commands worked when SSHing, so we decided to attempt compiling our code on GitBash
  using the same commands and our code ended up compiling and successfully running.
