## Faiza Huda, Gabriel Thompson, Tasnim Chowdhury
As a trio, we worked on each activity one at a time. In class Tasnim was the driver for activities 1-2 as Faiza and Gabriel discussed what to type. For the rest of the activities, we went through each activity discussing points of confusion and asked for clarification. Gabriel was the driver and Faiza and Tasnim typed out answers to the questions.
