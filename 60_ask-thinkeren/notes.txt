DISCO
- Once receiving a deck of cards for the first time, it is split in half and given
to 2 different people without a card
- If one has 2 different decks of cards, sort the two cards
- Everyone gives back the cards to whoever they got them from
- 2 decks of cards does not necessarily mean 2 single cards, just 2 sets from different places
QCC
- how many times does algo for merging 2 sorted lists happen depending on number of cards?
- who do you give the merged deck of cards to (since it came from 2 sources)?

THINKER FIRMWARE
1. Divide deck of cards in half when given cards and give each half to 2 other thinkers
2. When 2 decks of cards are in the possession of one thinker, the thinker merges the 2 decks of cards
(which are guaranteed sorted)
3. The thinker passes the merged deck of cards back to who they got a deck from?
