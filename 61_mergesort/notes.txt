DISCO
- Once receiving a deck of cards for the first time, it is split in half and given
to 2 different people without a card
- If one has 2 different decks of cards, sort the two cards
- Everyone gives back the cards to whoever they got them from
- 2 decks of cards does not necessarily mean 2 single cards, just 2 sets from different places

QCC
- how many times does algo for merging 2 sorted lists happen depending on number of cards?

THINKER FIRMWARE
1. Thinkeren with >1 card split their deck into half and give each half to another Thinkeren.
2. Thinkeren with 1 card are guaranteed a sorted deck. Return the card to the Thinkeren who had given you it. 
3. During this return process, the Thinkeren should receive 2 separate decks. Compare the first cards in each deck, and place the smaller card into a new, large deck. Repeat this process until the Thinkeren has one large deck that is sorted.  
4. Once you have one large sorted deck, return it to the Thinkeren who had given you it. Repeat step 3 until eventually, one Thinkeren possesses the entire, complete deck of cards that is sorted.
