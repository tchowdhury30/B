  Given an array of ints, is it possible to choose a group of some of the ints,
  such that the group sums to the given target? This is a classic backtracking
  recursion problem. Once you understand the recursive backtracking strategy in
  this problem, you can use the same pattern for many problems to search a space
  of choices. Rather than looking at the whole array, our convention is to consider
  the part of the array starting at index start and continuing to the end of the array.
  The caller can specify the whole array simply by passing start as 0. No loops
  are needed -- the recursive calls progress down the array.
